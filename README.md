# KaggleProjects

Currently, an initial attempt at completing the tutorial Titanic project on Kaggle.

Code is converted from a ipython notebook, and should be sufficiently commented to describe what is accomplished with the code.

Further work will be done on other projects in collaboration with two colleagues, which may be migrated to separate git repos.
